# Numerical solutions to Ordinary differential equations
Blogpost and web demos about numerical solutions to ODEs with interactive demos

## Preview

Ordinary differential equations, are equations that involve ordinary derivatives of a function and the function itself. The order of the differential equation is characterized by the highest order derivative it contains. ODEs    are used to model a variety of systems like the stock market, orbiting planets or predator prey systems. In this    article, we will explore a few numerical methods for solving the following first order equation in JavaScript.
